# BookBinder

BookBinder is a book website that allows its users to explore a vast collection of books categorised by genre. Users can leave reviews to share their thoughts and help others find their next captivating read. The website allows users to register their accounts to not only write reviews, but also create their own reading list with their favorite books. 

## Features

BookBinder contains a variety of features:
* Register and login 
* Homepage containing all books
* Search and filter feature to find books according to their title and genre
* Add/remove from favorites feature, display reading list
* Write review for a specific book
* View book reviews 

## Usage 

To browse to the website, users can search for https://a22web32.studev.groept.be - NO LONGER AVAILABLE

BookBinder functions on any web browser and is designed for easy use. The homepage contains a few recommendations as well as a list of all books in the database. It also has a top bar allowing users to access different pages like their reading list and the contact page for the website. The book list being displayed can be changed by using the search bar as well as the filter by genres checkboxes. These allow the user to find any book they are looking for through their title or genre. 

At the top right of the page, users can click the login button to connect with their account. They can also hit the register button in case they do not already have one. Being logged in to the website allows users to compile their own reading list and to leave reviews on books. Users are also able to change their accounts information through the profile page, allowing them to customise it. 

From the homepage, clicking on any book (whether it be on the cover or the name) sends the user to that book's page. This page contains information such as the author of the book and its summary. It also allows users to view reviews that have been left about the book, as well as write their own along with the score they wish to assign to it. The last function on this page is the add to favorites button which lets users add the book to their reading list. 

## Downloading and editing BookBinder

### Dependencies

BookBinder is coded using html, css, php, and javascript. It uses multiple php libraries, e.g. Doctrine, which are controlled through the Symfony framework. Php must already be downloaded and configured to properly run the code. 

### Software

BookBinder was developed on IntelliJ and we recommend users to install it through this software. The following plug ins were employed to create the website:
* PHP
* EnvFile
* PHP Annotations
* PHP Toolbox
* Symfony Support
* DQL
* Twig

### Installation

The BookBinder code is available in the gitlab repository and can be copied and altered through cloning it. 

## Documentation

The code also provides explanations for most of its files through the extensive annotation that was added to it. These serve to help developers understand what each function in the code does.
