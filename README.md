## Usage 

BookBinder functions on any web browser and is designed for easy use. The homepage contains a few recommendations as well as a list of all books in the database. It also has a top bar allowing users to access different pages like their reading list and the contact page for the website. The book list being displayed can be changed by using the search bar as well as the filter by genres checkboxes. These allow the user to find any book they are looking for through their title or genre. At the top right of the page, users can click the login button to connect with their account. They can also hit the register button in case they do not already have one. Being logged in to the website allows users to compile their own reading list and to leave reviews on books. From the homepage, clicking on any book (whether it be on the cover or the name) sends the user to that book's page. This page contains information such as the author of the book and its summary. It also allows users to view reviews that have been left about the book, as well as write their own along with the score they wish to assign to it. The last function on this page is the add to favorites button which lets users add the book to their reading list.
